A Raspberry Pi-driven little peephole theater

Inspired by the [Peephole Cinema](https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/peephole-cinema) in San Francisco, I wanted to see if I could replicate that with a Raspberry Pi.

My other plan is to build a little box for the theater to go in with some seats and curtains. Or maybe a cigar box? I'd like to have some curtains that open and close between films, driven by a little motor.

It sounds fun to me.
